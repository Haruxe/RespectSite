        body: <p>To respect the bean one must gently roast the coffee bean, crack it open to release its aromatic essence, and bathe it in water which results in a fitered brew for your enjoyment. Often, we do not truly appreciate the importance that coffee plays in our lives. Those of us who drink it, it pushes us to help achieve our goals, as a sort of tag-team. For others, it fights in the battlefield of the workplace and daily life to attack drowsiness and lack of energy.</p>,

        body: <p>To get the best flavor for your dollar, roasting at home is the best way to go. To start, you need to have green beans and a roaster. There are a lot of green bean vendors, but my favorite are the ones sold on <a href='https://www.sweetmarias.com/green-coffee.html' target={'_blank'} style={{color: '#C77037'}}>Sweet Marias</a>. My favorite is their New Ginea or Columbia beans. In comparison to pre-roasted beans, they are very cheap and you can get a whole lot for your dollar. Decide what kind of roast you prefer and follow along with a youtube video while roasting. Finding a good grinder is very important as well, where I recommend getting a hand grinder like <a href="https://amzn.to/3GsrwjD" target={'_blank'} style={{color: '#C77037'}}>this one from ezpresso</a> to start because they can afford to have a nicer burr for cheap.</p>
